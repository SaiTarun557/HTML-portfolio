<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! I'm Tarun and I've recently started to learn the web development. When I started practicing this in VS Code, then I realised that it is going to be interesting and super fun. I've always tried to learn the web development during my studies but I procastinated.
  Now, I think I'm doing well in this field. As a part of this I've created small projects just by using HTML without any stylings. Electronics was my field of study in my Bachelor's but I was always interested in coding. I was afraid of coding and I was in a state that I can't even able to code for 15 mins in a day. Now, I'm slowly trying to make a habit of it.
