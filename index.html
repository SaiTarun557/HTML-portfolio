        <li>
            <p>Bachelor's Thesis: Implementation of Multi-hop protocol
                with cost function for decreasing energy consumption in nodes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overview:</li>
                    <p>The project focused on revolutionizing energy consumption in wire-
                        less communication networks by implementing a Multi-hop Protocol with an
                        innovative cost function. The objective was crystal clear: to drastically reduce
                        energy consumption in nodes during data transmission to the sink or base station
                        while simultaneously boosting network efficiency.</p>
                    <li>Key Achievements:</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Reduced energy consumption by an impressive 55%.</li>
                        <li>Successfully managed to prolong the operational lifespan of nodes by 90%.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Key Responsibilities:</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Conducted an exhaustive study on prevailing multi-hop protocols and meticu-
                            lously analyzed node energy usage within wireless communication networks.</li>
                        <li>Developed and implemented protocol, which resulted in a substantial 55%
                            reduction in energy consumption during data transmission.</li>
                        <li>Published a technical report highlighting the project's findings and its potential
                            impact on the wireless communication industry.</li>
                    </ol>

        <li>Burglar Alarm System with Code-based Disarm using Delay</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview:</li>
            <p>Designed and implemented a Burglar Alarm System with an innovative code-based disarm feature for enhanced security.</p>
            <li>Components:</li>
            <p>The system utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and a Passive
                Infrared (PIR) motion sensor to detect unauthorized intrusions. Additionally, a
                keypad module is integrated toallow usersy to disarm the system using a secret
                code within a predefined time limit.</p>
            <li>Overview:</li><p>The project aimed to protect residential and commercial properties
                from potential break-ins while providing a user-friendly disarm mechanism.</p>
